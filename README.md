# Goal

The goal is to have a very lightweight Arch installation, with `Wayland` and `Sway`. We are going to use `waybar` as the status bar on top of the screen, and `neovim` and `helix` plus a basic `Rust` setup. We going to have Bluetooth, WiFi working, as well as Sound and some basic special keys like Volume Up/Down + Screen brightness.
